# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, where I'll be practicing the HTML skills I've learned by creating a recipe website.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic recipe website that demonstrates fundamental HTML concepts including:
- HTML structure and semantic elements
- Creating links between pages
- Working with lists (ordered and unordered)
- Adding images
- Text formatting and organization

## What I'm Building

A simple recipe website that includes:
- A main index page with links to individual recipes
- Individual recipe pages featuring:
  - Recipe descriptions
  - Ingredients lists
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions
  - Food images

## Skills Practiced

- **HTML Structure**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements
- **Navigation**: Creating internal links between pages
- **Content Organization**: Using headings, paragraphs, and lists effectively
- **Image Integration**: Adding and organizing images
- **File Organization**: Managing multiple HTML files in a project structure

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Basic file structure and organization

```

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I'm aiming to:
- Solidify my understanding of basic HTML syntax
- Practice creating multi-page websites
- Learn proper file organization for web projects
- Get comfortable with HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`
- Understand the importance of semantic markup

## Future Enhancements

As I progress through The Odin Project, I plan to revisit this project and add:
- CSS styling for better visual presentation
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- JavaScript interactivity
- Better accessibility features

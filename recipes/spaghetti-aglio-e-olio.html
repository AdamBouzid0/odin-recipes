    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is one of the most classic and beloved Italian pasta dishes. This simple yet elegant recipe from Naples uses just a few high-quality ingredients to create something truly magical. The name literally means "spaghetti with garlic and oil," and that's exactly what makes this dish so special - its beautiful simplicity.</p>
    <p>Despite using only basic pantry ingredients, this dish requires technique and timing to achieve the perfect balance of flavors. The key is slowly cooking the garlic in olive oil until fragrant and golden, creating a silky sauce that coats each strand of pasta. It's the perfect late-night meal or when you want something delicious without a trip to the grocery store.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add sliced garlic to the oil and cook slowly, stirring frequently, until golden and fragrant (about 2-3 minutes). Don't let it brown or it will become bitter.</li>
        <li>Add red pepper flakes if using and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the garlic oil.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta with the oil, adding pasta water a little at a time to create a silky sauce that coats the noodles.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and add chopped parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and additional salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with remaining cheese on the side.</li>
    </ol>
